## About - v2.5

This is an evolution of the original getAllParams extension for Burp. Not only does it find more potential parameters for you to investigate, but it also finds potential links to try these parameters on, and produces a target specific wordlist to use for fuzzing.
The full Help documentation can be found [here] (https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/burp-extensions/blob/main/GAP%20Help.md) or from the Help icon on the GAP tab.

## TL;DR

### Installation

1. Visit [Jython Offical Site](https://www.jython.org/download), and download the latest stand alone JAR file, e.g. `jython-standalone-2.7.3.jar`.
2. Open Burp, go to **Extensions** -> **Extension Settings** -> **Python Environment**, set the **Location of Jython standalone JAR file** and **Folder for loading modules** to the directory where the Jython JAR file was saved.
3. On a command line, go to the directory where the jar file is and run `java -jar jython-standalone-2.7.3.jar -m ensurepip`.
4. Download the `GAP.py` and `requirements.txt` from this project and place in the same directory.
5. Install Jython modules by running `java -jar jython-standalone-2.7.3.jar -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Go to the **Extensions** -> **Installed** and click **Add** under **Burp Extensions**.
7. Select **Extension type** of **Python** and select the **GAP.py** file.

### Using

1. Just select a target in your Burp scope (or multiple targets), or even just one subfolder or endpoint, and choose extension **GAP**:

2. Then go to the **GAP** tab to see the results:

## Notes

If you don't need one of the modes, then un-check it as results will be quicker.
The Words mode uses the `beautifulsoup4` library and this can be quite slow, so be patient!

## TODO

1. Save output in a directory folder per domain, and add timestamp to output files.
2. Use an alternative to `beautifulsoup4` that is faster to parse responses for Words.
3. Provide an option to see Origin Endpoint for parameters (only where it is appropriate for the parameter type).

Good luck and good hunting!
